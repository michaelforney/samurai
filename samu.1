.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
loads a build manifest from
.Ar buildfile
and rebuilds
.Ar targets
if they are out of date.
If no targets are specified, the manifest's default targets are built.
If there are no default targets, the leaf nodes of the dependency graph are
built (outputs that have no consuming action).
.Pp
Targets are out of date if they are older than the generating action's newest
input, they have no entry in the build log, or if the command to build the
target differs from what was used previously.
Targets built with
.Cm generator
rules are not rebuilt if the command changes.
.Pp
If the
.Cm clean
tool is used, the targets are cleaned instead.
When a target is cleaned, it is removed and are all of its inputs are cleaned.
Targets with no generating actions are never removed.
Targets built with
.Sy generator
rules are only removed if
.Fl g
is specified.
.Pp
If the
.Cm compdb
tool is used, a compilation database
.Lk ( https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html )
is printed instead.
.Pp
If the
.Cm targets
tool is used, a list of targets will be displayed, either by rule or by depth.
If a name is given as an argument to the rule mode, a list of targets using the
given rule will be displayed. If no name is given, a list of source files is
displayed. If a value is given as an argument to the depth mode, a list of
targets will be displayed in a depth-first way, starting by the root targets
(the targets with no outputs). If the depth is 0, all targets will be displayed.
If no arguments is provided to the depth mode, a depth of 1 will be assumed. If
no mode is specified, a list of all targets is displayed.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Switch working directory to
.Ar dir
before building.
.It Fl d
Enable a debugging option.
This flag may be specified multiple times to enable multiple debugging options.
Possible values for
.Ar debugflag
are:
.Bl -tag -width keepdepfile
.It Cm explain
Print messages explaining why outputs were dirty.
.It Cm keepdepfile
Don't remove $depfile after it was parsed.
.It Cm keeprsp
Don't remove $rspfile after job completion or failure.
.El
.It Fl f
Load manifest from
.Ar buildfile
instead of build.ninja.
.It Fl j
Run up to
.Ar maxjobs
jobs in parallel (default based on number of CPUs).
If zero, allow unlimited concurrent jobs.
.It Fl k
Allow up to
.Ar maxfail
job failures.
If negative or zero, allow any number of job failures.
.It Fl v
Print full commands instead of just
.Sy description .
.It Fl w
Control how certain errors are handled.
If
.Ar warnflag
is
.Cm dupbuild ,
.Ar action
specifies what to do if an output is listed in multiple build edges.
If
.Ar action
is
.Cm err ,
treat it like an error and fail.
If
.Ar action
is
.Cm warn ,
only print a diagnostic message.
.It Fl t
Instead of building, invoke a subtool.
All arguments and flags after the subtool are interpreted by the subtool.
The currently supported subtools are
.Cm clean
and
.Cm compdb .
.It Fl g
When cleaning, also clean outputs of
.Sy generator
actions.
.It Fl r
.Ar targets
are interpreted as rules, and all outputs of actions with the specified rule
types will be cleaned instead.
.It Fl x
When printing a compilation database, replace @$rspfile with $rspfile_content (with <blank> in place of <newline>).
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width NINJA_STATUS
.It Ev SAMUFLAGS
Options for
.Nm
that get applied before those specified on the command-line.
The only options allowed in
.Ev SAMUFLAGS
are
.Fl v
and
.Fl j .
.It Ev NINJA_STATUS
The status output printed to the left of each rule description, using printf-like conversion specifiers.
If unset, the default is "[%s/%t] ".
.Pp
Available conversion specifiers:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm %s
Number of started jobs.
.It Cm %f
Number of finished jobs.
.It Cm %t
Total number of jobs.
.It Cm %r
Number of running jobs.
.It Cm %u
Number of remaining jobs.
.It Cm %p
Percentage of completed jobs.
.It Cm %e
Elapsed time in seconds (to 3 decimal places).
.It Cm %%
The '%' character.
